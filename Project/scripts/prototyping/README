Scripts
-------

Build_VNTR_Sequence.py
Commandline script to build a fastq file with the VNTR copies present. 

Build_VNTR_Cases.sh
Generates specific cases of the VNTR sequences for analysis. 

Simulate_Reads_Mapping.sh
Runs the read simulator ART on the cases made in Build_VNTR_Cases. 


Workflow
-------
Step 1) Generate a sequence containing a VNTR (Building_VNTR_Sequence.py + Build_VNTR_Cases.sh).
Step 2) Simulate reads and mapping (Simulate_Read_Mapping.sh). 


Data Dependencies
-----------------
Step 1 to 2) 
	case, the case number you need to simulate reads for. 
	seqLen, the length of the context sequence.

	These two values are needed to construct the path to the input fasta file. 
	which follows the format: sequence_${seqLen}_case_${case}.fa.
